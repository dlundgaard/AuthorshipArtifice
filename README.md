# Cognitive Authorship Illusions w/ EEG

Adaptation of Logan & Crump (2010)[^1], adding EEG-recording to the experimental setup with the aim of shedding further light on dissociation of two distinct monitoring systems in a typing task.

## Quickstart
1. Download/clone the repository locally
2. Run the directory as a module (`python cognitive-authorship-illusions`) to launch the experiment

## Analysis
>![](showcase/post_manipulation_slowing.png)
>Following a manipulation, slowing effects creep in gradually, peaking at a delay of three or four trials since the manipulation before tapering off.
